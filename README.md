# Java Training

My name is Mahsa, I want to solve some Cool Questions with Java.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Questions:

#### Q01. (RandomNumber) - An array that generates random numbers will print the number of numbers whose last elements are zero.
#### Q02. (Multiplication) - Multiplication table.
#### Q03. (HighOrLow) - It takes the number n from the input and returns the word high if the number n is equal to or greater than 1000, and returns the word low if it is less than 1000.
#### Q04. (EvenNumbers) - Print even numbers between n and 2n
#### Q05. (DigitsNumbers) - Write a method that takes the number n from the input and returns the number of its digits. For example, it returns "5" for the number "34287".
#### Q06. (SumDigits) - Write a method that takes the number n from the input and returns the sum of its digits. For example, it returns "24" for the number "34287".
#### Q07. (ReverseDigits) - Write a method that takes the number n from the input and returns its inverse. For example, if " n=356" , the output value will be "653". (Note that the question does not ask you to print the number in reverse, but you should calculate the numerical value of the reversed number.
#### Q08. (CompleteNumber) - Write a method that takes the number n from the input and checks if that number is complete or not and returns a Boolean output.
#### Q09. (PrimeNumber) - Write a method that takes the number n from the input and checks if it is prime or not and returns a Boolean output.
#### Q10. (RemainderDividedNumbers) - Write a program (in the main method) that calculates and prints the sum of all numbers between 1 and 1000 whose remainder when divided by 3 times 1 using a while loop.
#### Q11. (AbsoluteValue) - Write a method that takes the number n from the input and returns the absolute value of n.
#### Q11. (PhotosNumbers -> PictureNumbers01) - Write a method that takes the number n from the input and prints the result according to the figure below (it does not need to be output), for example, if n is equal to 4, print it.

#### Q11. (PhotosNumbers -> PictureNumbers02) - Write a method that takes the number n from the input and prints the result according to the figure below (it does not need to be output), for example, if n is equal to 4, print it.

#### Q11. (PhotosNumbers -> PictureOneAndStar) - Write a method that takes the number n from the input and prints the result according to the figure below (it does not need to be output), for example, if n is equal to 4, print it.

#### Q11. (Rectangle) - Write a method that takes the length and width of a rectangle from the input and returns the perimeter and area of the rectangle.



## Answerer place:
* <b> Q1: GenerateRandom </b> Is a method that has an array of numbers as an input, and for example, we want 100 random numbers (the user can receive them.)
<b> Math.rand() give us a number between 0 - 1 </b>, so we need to multiplication to another number that make 0 for end of our digit.
   The output of the random number was a decimal number, so we used <b>int a </b> for convert decimal to digits so that it loses its bits.
<b >CountZeroes</b> you can print and see all elements Numbers that end in zero.  

* <b> Q2:  main method </b>  Because we didn't need special calculations and just wanted to display a multiplication table, we used the main method.
  <b> The first loop </b> calculates the multiplication table and <b> The second loop </b> is to create an empty line so that the multiplication table can be displayed more beautifully.

* <b> Q3:  main method </b>  Because we didn't need special calculations and just wanted to display a multiplication table, we used the main method.
  <b> The first loop </b> calculates the multiplication table and <b> The second loop </b> is to create an empty line so that the multiplication table can be displayed more beautifully.
