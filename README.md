# Java Training

My name is Mahsa, I want to solve some Cool Questions with Java.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Questions:

#### Q1. An array that generates random numbers will print the number of numbers whose last elements are zero.
#### Q2. Multiplication table.


## Answerer place:
* <b> Q1: GenerateRandom </b> Is a method that has an array of numbers as an input, and for example, we want 100 random numbers (the user can receive them.)
<b> Math.rand() give us a number between 0 - 1 </b>, so we need to multiplication to another number that make 0 for end of our digit.
   The output of the random number was a decimal number, so we used <b>int a </b> for convert decimal to digits so that it loses its bits.
<b >CountZeroes</b> you can print and see all elements Numbers that end in zero.  

* <b> Q2:  main method </b>  Because we didn't need special calculations and just wanted to display a multiplication table, we used the main method.
  <b> The first loop </b> calculates the multiplication table and <b> The second loop </b> is to create an empty line so that the multiplication table can be displayed more beautifully.
